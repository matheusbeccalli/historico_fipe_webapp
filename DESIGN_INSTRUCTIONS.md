Create a webapp that looks like it belongs on Awwwards/Dribbble. 

**Visual Style:**
- Neutral backgrounds, single accent color, refined typography, subtle interactions, premium spacing
- Color combinations:
  - Warm Professional
    - Background: white to amber-50
    - Accents: amber-600 to orange-600
    - Text: gray-900 / amber-800


**Make it premium enough that I'd screenshot and share it. Add:**
- Smooth hover animations and micro-interactions
- Bold typography with proper hierarchy  
- Perfect spacing and visual flow
- High contrast and accessibility
- Current 2024/2025 design trends

**Reference sites:** Think Stripe/Linear/Framer quality

Don't make it functional but boring - make it STUNNING.
